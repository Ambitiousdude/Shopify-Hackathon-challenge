### üìñ Project Overview

The Hackathon challenge is a Figma design that you have to bring to life as a frontend engineer. The Figma design is an exact replica of the Shopify onboarding dashboard. This is the dashboard that is used by Shopify's 1.75 million merchants to sell millions in ecommerce products.

My challenge is to build a responsive merchant onboarding experience following the Figma design provided. You are to cater for the three most popular types of Shopify merchants:

1. Mouse users
2. Keyboard-only users
3. Screen reader users

-- You are to create a fully responsive experience for users on these device types:

- Mobile Phones (Google Chrome Browser Only)
- Desktops (Google Chrome Browser Only)

### üíª Features

The features consists of

- Shopify icon: As a merchant, when I click on the Shopify icon on the top bar, I am taken to the shopify landing page shopify.com

- Search box: As a merchant, when I focus on the search box on the top bar, I can freely type into the input. At the moment, no further actions or results should occur. A merchant should only be able to type freely in the box.

- Notification bell: As a merchant, when I click on the notification bell, I see a dropdown panel that shows me an empty list of notifications since I have none yet. When I click on the notification bell again, this dropdown panel is closed.

- Name of the store (DC): As a merchant, when I click on the name of my store Davii Collections, or on my profile image placeholder DC on the far right of the topbar menu, I see a menu with a list of menu items as specified by the Figma design. Clicking on this button again closes the menu. Finally, when I click on any of the menu items in this menu, I am redirected toadmin.shopify.com

- Select plan: As a merchant, when I click on theSelect plan link, I am redirected to the Shopify pricing page atshopify.com/pricing

- Arrow Up: As a merchant, when I click the "Arrow Up" icon on the top right of the Setup guide card, it closes the card. When I click again, it reopens the card.

### üîñ Roadmap and future enhancement
